**Abstract**
Climate change can trigger excessive rainfall, making mechanized soybean harvesting impossible. The off-season corn cultivation can benefit from soybean crop residues inoculated with Bradyrhizobium spp. strains, as a potential biological source of nitrogen (N). To suppress the nutritional demand of corn crops, N fertilization management is essential. Recent research has sought to understand how corn cultivars respond to mineral N application. In this work, we employ a modern methodology to select corn cultivars with greater response to the application of mineral N fertilizer rates in addition to biological N from soybean crop residues. We used the Manhattan distance to verify the similarity between the responses of four corn cultivars (30F53VYHR, AG8700 PRO3B2433PWU, and SYN7G17 TL) not fertilized com N and fertilized with 40, 80, 120, and 160 kg N ha-1. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution method to select the most responsive cultivar was applied. We concluded that among the four corn cultivars, SYN7G17TL and AG8700PRO3 are more responsive to N fertilizer application in medium and high-fertility agricultural soils, respectively. When we disregard the level of soil fertility, the AG8700PRO3 cultivar has greater potential response to N fertilization, agreeing with previous studies.
